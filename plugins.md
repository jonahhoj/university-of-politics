# Plugins
1. [Ajax Search Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ajax-search-lite/)    
Used to alter the original search bar and search.php files.
1. [All In Menu](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-menu/)    
Used to alter the look of the menu to what Devon wanted it to be. Without this, I'm pretty sure there's a bar missing below the menu.
1. [Archive Page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/archive-page/)    
Used to make an easily accessible and readable archive page for the plugin.
1. [Beaver Builder and the booster](http://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/)    
This came automatically with the Wordpress hosting from Godaddy, but it's basically a drag-and-drop way of easily formatting pages.
1. [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)    
Used to make a form similar to Ninja Forms, except editable in every way, from email sending on trigger to different kinds of looks.
1. [Contact Widgets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-widgets/)    
This is the default social media plugin that came with our Godaddy hosting, I don't think that we still use it for our social media buttons.
1. [Date Published Shortcode](https://wordpress.org/plugins/date-published-shortcode/)    
This I made just so that I don't have to check the date every god damn time that I post an article. It saves like 3 seconds.
1. [Easy Google Fonts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-google-fonts/)    
This is used to change the default font of the site to something other than the original Wordpress fonts.
1. [Easy Twitter Feed Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-twitter-feed-widget/)    
This is used for the Highlighted News page, to display the Twitter feeds of various news sources.
1. [Give+](https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/)    
This is the main platform for our donations page. We never get any money anyway, so whatever happens to this is fine.
1. [Insert Headers and Footers](https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers/)    
Got this because we got bored of editing the theme files every time we wanted to try something new in the header or footer.
1. [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/)    
Jetpack is a plugin run by Wordpress itself to display analytics, change settings, and more.
1. [Metaslider](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ml-slider/)    
This is used to display the front page slider. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the design, but not much else is available in the way of plugins. A redo of this would be welcome.    
1. [Private Site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jonradio-private-site/)
When this is on, the site displays an "Under Construction" page to all those not logged in. This was used during the initial development, but now that we have the core, in the future we could use a subdomain to format changes.
1. [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/)    
An easy drag-and-drop form creator.
1. [Tags and Categories for Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-tags-and-categories-for-pages/)    
This was just to help me organize the articles, it doesn't show up on the front end.
1. [Profile Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/profile-builder/)    
This one's pretty important, it allows for user registration, profile editing, and comments integration.
1. [Reveal Admin ID's](https://wordpress.org/plugins/reveal-ids-for-wp-admin-25/)    
This shows the ids of articles, pages, etc, so I can specify the usage of plugins on each page.
1. [Shortcodes in Menus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-in-menus/)    
This works in conjuction with the All-in-Menu plugin to replace the original menu. It lets the All-in-Menu shortcode be displayed in the slot for the original menu.
1. [Social Pug](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-pug/)    
This is our main social button/sharing plugin.
1. [Title Remover](https://wordpress.org/plugins/title-remover/)    
This allows us to remove the title of the homepage (home).
1. [Widget Context](https://github.com/kasparsd/widget-context-wporg)    
This shows or hides content based on the state of the user (logged in, logged out) or based on the page of the site.
1. [User Avatars](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-avatar/)    
This allows users to set their own avatars for comments in the "Edit Profile" page.
1. [WP-Polls](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-polls/)    
This allows for a front-end AJAX poll to be placed as a widget anywhere on the site.
1. [wpDiscuz](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpdiscuz/)    
A newer, sleeker comments system.
1. [WPtouch](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wptouch/)    
This is used to create and format the mobile version of the site.
1. [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)    
This is used for generalized search engine optimization, as well as sitemaps for search engine crawler bots, settings, etc.

There are a few other plugins that we use, but aren't all that important. You can check our plugins out for yourself on the Plugins page of the Admin Dashboard at www.universityofpolitics.com.
