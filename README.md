### About the Current State of Things    
Wordpress organizes our code in interesting ways, using our main theme (vdPeranto) and various plugins (for instance, Ninja Forms,
which is used to create contact forms or polls). Of our 34 plugins, many are built into the way that the website functions, such as the menu plugin. When we recreate the site from scratch as I suspect we may be doing, we could attempt to simply write a theme for
Wordpress to interpret and continue to use Wordpress as our main vehicle of site function. We could alternatively switch our
hosting plan with Godaddy to a non-Wordpress plan when our current subscription runs out, and build the website from scratch.
Wordpress is an incredibly flexible blog engine, however, and creating/formatting new articles could prove to be more complex than
anticipated if we leave Wordpress.
### About the Files in this Project
Here I'll have included the theme files for vdPeranto (some changes have been made to the source code without using a child theme
because we're not pussies), as well as a markdown file listing our current plugins. You should be able to see the source code of 
each plugin at the [Wordpress Plugin Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).
### About Me
I'm a junior at Nordhoff High School in Ojai, CA.
Devon is my sister's boyfriend, and I was the first guy around when he wanted to make this whole thing happen. I know HTML and CSS
to the extent that I need to run a Wordpress site, and I've done a lot of learning on the way. I know enough Javascript to tell 
where to tweak a variable, but not enough to write it on its own. You, majoring in Computer science at an Ivy League, obviously
know more than I about coding, so I'm totally open to a redesign of the website under your jurisdiction. 
### A Little About University of Politics
I'm not sure how much you're acquainted with the state of things at U of P, not sure how much Devon's filled you in, but just for
the sake of clarity I'll make a list of our people.
*Devon is our CEO and co-founder.
*Our Editor-in-Chief is Bradley Devlin, President of the UC Berkeley College Republicans.
*Josh Zaucha is our CFO and other co-founder.
*I'm our CTO, as well as a contributor.
*Some of our prominent contributors
  *Avery Klatsky
  *Andrew Olivo
  *Declan Leary
  *Nick Nordstrom
  *a bunch of others that I don't remember    

I'm glad to be working with you on this! We've been a little stalled on writing for the last couple months as finals got nearer, 
but with the summer session here we'll get back on track.
